# Pinyin Tonal Marking

This is a VS Code extension for converting the commonly used tonal marking format to their Unicode counterparts.

For example:
- `a1` -> `ā`
- `E3` -> `Ě`
- `v4` -> `ǜ`

## Why does this exist?

When writing synchronized lyrics for my downloaded songs, I wanted to include both chinese and pinyin in chinese songs.

Why don't I just download lyrics and use them instead? Because it's rare to see chinese lyrics with piniyn included.

There are websites that do the same thing, but the whole process feels unintuitive, since it involves copy-pasting.

I've thought about making an input method editor (IME), but I would need to digitally sign it to be able to use it ([link to the reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/input/input-method-editors#requirements-for-imes)), thanks Microsoft.
